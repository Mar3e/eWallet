# eWalletApp

This project is a side project I use to learn new things in flutter and in coding in general, I will List below what things I'm using what architecture what packages and other things.

## The project architecture
I'm currently learning to implement the **MVVM** architecture it may be over kill for this project but it's a good start for me in learning.

## The packages
1. The first package I want to learn is **Provider** (to help my understand state management more).
